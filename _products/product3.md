This piece is one of four variants of the drypoint etch ‘Owl’. The pieces are done as drypoint etchings, and added watercolour to add flair. The set can be purchased as a bundle and would look amazing all framed together! This option can be negotiated with me over email. Shipping will vary depending on where you are located.
